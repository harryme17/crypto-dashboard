## üöÄ How to Run This Project Locally

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your computer.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
*   A free [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project
*   A free [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) account and form

### Installation & Setup Guide

1.  **Get the code:**
    If you have cloned the repository, navigate into the project folder.
    ```bash
    cd crypto-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary libraries.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your secret keys:**
    This project uses an environment file (`.env`) to keep secret keys separate from the code, which is a critical best practice.
    
    First, copy the example template to create your own local secrets file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the newly created `.env` file and fill in your unique keys.

    *   **Get Firebase Keys:** Go to your Firebase project -> Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) -> General tab -> Your apps -> SDK setup and configuration. Select "Config" and copy the values.
    *   **Get Formspree ID:** Go to your Formspree dashboard -> Select your form. The ID is the 8-character string in the endpoint URL (e.g., `mqkrvypb`).

4.  **Authorize Formspree for Local Use (Important!):**
    For the email feature to work on your machine, you must tell Formspree to trust `localhost`.
    *   Go to your Formspree form's **Settings** tab.
    *   Scroll down to **Domains**.
    *   Add `http://localhost:3000` and save.

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The app will automatically open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
